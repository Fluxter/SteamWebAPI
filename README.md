SteamWebAPI
==============
Note! This is not my project. It's a fork from [Codeplex / PortableSteam](https://portablesteamwebapi.codeplex.com/) i'm only fixing some bugs.

Description
-----------
A .NetStandard c# library that intuitively requests data from Valve's Steam Web API service using fluent design pattern.


The goal of this project is to allow C# developers who intend to use the Steam Web API to pull data from the Valve API server easily without worrying about syntax, interface names, method names and parameters. This portable class library is designed to be intuitive, robust and will hopefully help developers focus on other parts of their exciting application! 

Most methods, comments and various documentation are from the official WebAPI documentation: http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/WebAPI
